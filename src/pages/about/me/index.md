# TL;DR

Hi! üëã I'm Matt.

I write software for a living, but I'm a dorky little kid at heart. I have two modes: "sleeping" and "hey, what's this do?" In my spare time, I'm usually learning stuff, building stuff, playing with stuff, or stuffing my face. I love talking to people, but mostly over the internet.

# Some random facts

üëç **I write left-handed**, which makes for fun times when I‚Äôm in front of a whiteboard. (Or --- you know --- the _opposite_ of that.) I‚Äôm right-hand dominant in a lot of other activities, though, so I guess that makes me‚Ä¶ semi-ambidextrous?

üò¨ **I have chronic anxiety.** Sometimes it sucks, but it‚Äôs also driven me to learn more about stress, emotions, and how to understand other people.

üñ• **My first computer** was a Packard Bell. It had a 75MHz processor, a 500-megabyte hard drive, and came with Windows 3.1!

üåé **I grew up in a small town** in Kentucky before moving to Nashville. We had one police officer and zero traffic lights. (Total population: around 500)

üíç **I‚Äôve been happily married since 2011.** For our first date, we went to a live performance of _The Rocky Horror Picture Show_!

üêï **My wife and I have two dogs: Mocha and Cookie.** We adopted both of them from rescue shelters. They‚Äôre the absolute sweetest.

# What I do at work

I write software!

... right --- that was a bit _vague_. Sorry.

Mostly I write business software. The bulk of my work is in "back end"-ish stuff like web services and integrations, but I love being a full-stack generalist when I get the chance. My current job focuses on development for the Salesforce platform, but in the past I've delivered software in .NET, Java, JavaScript, and Python.

# What I do for fun

My hobbies fall pretty neatly into three categories: learning, building, and eating.

(Shut up. Eating _is too_ a hobby.)

Learning and building both stimulate my lifelong curiosity for how things work. Whether it's <a href="#fun-disclaimer">code*</a>, machinery, furniture, or food, I've always had a habit of tinkering with darn near everything I can get my hands on. When the weather's nice, that means doing my own automotive maintenance and setting up DIY projects. Other times --- especially when it's cold and dreary out --- I like to read books and try new recipes in the kitchen (usually sweets and desserts).

_<a id="fun-disclaimer">*</a>One note on programming, though: To protect myself against burnout, **I don't code much outside the office.** It's not that I don't enjoy it (because I do), but I've been burnt out once before, and it's no fun. To make sure it never happens again, I limit my time in front of the keyboard and set firm boundaries between work and home._

# Where to find me

Well, first of all, I don‚Äôt really get out a lot. üòÖ But if you do catch me adventuring out in the world, it's probably because I'm searching for food! I love finding new and different places to eat, especially when I'm traveling.

I‚Äôm a pretty private person, but I do try to get out of my shell and engage from time to time. I like sitting in for [PyNash](https://www.meetup.com/PyNashexample.com/)‚Äôs monthly Python meetup, and I‚Äôve been to a couple local development conferences ([PyTennessee](https://www.pytennessee.orgexample.com/) and [Music City Code](https://musiccitycodexample.com/)). I‚Äôd really like to get out to a few larger ones --- international events like [PyCon](https://us.pycon.orgexample.com/), [JSConf](https://2019.jsconf.usexample.com/), or [The Lead Developer](https://theleaddeveloperexample.com/) --- but scheduling and travel expenses have made that difficult so far. Here‚Äôs hoping for next year!

In true introverted fashion, a lot of my social life happens over the internet. I‚Äôm particularly active in [WeAllJS](https://wealljs.orgexample.com/) and [Data for Democracy](https://datafordemocracy.orgexample.com/), which are both amazing organizations full of kind, helpful people. They give me goals to aspire to, jokes and good news to smile to, and smart advice I can set my watch to. If you're interested in that sort of thing, they're well worth checking out.
